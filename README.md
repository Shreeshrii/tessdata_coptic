# tessdata_coptic
Traineddata files for Tesseract 4.0.0 for Coptic OCR

These traineddata files were created in response to a request in [tesseract-ocr forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/tesseract-ocr/LXIxi4KxmNQ/unoOhL9yAAAJ)

They are 'float' models similar to files in tessdata_best and can be used to `continue from` for further training.

They can be converted to `integer` models similar to files in tessdata_fast to speed up the recognition.
